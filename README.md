# Overview

Trash Collector is a Python/Django MVT web application that provides a platform for managing a (hypothetical) municipal trash collection service. Created as a partner project for devCodeCamp, Trash Collector allows users to create accounts as either customers or employees. Customers can manage their profile, select a weekly trash pickup day, schedule one-time pickups, view their bills, and make payments. Employees have a designated pickup area (organized by ZIP code) and are assigned customers accordingly based on the customer's address. Employees can manage their customers' accounts, see their pickup schedule, mark pickups as complete, charge customer accounts, and see maps of their pickup routes (powered by the Google Maps API).
